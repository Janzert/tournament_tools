tournament simulator. It's expanded to cover more possible events in a
tournament.

Lines beginning with # or * are comments and the rest of the line is ignored.

Player's are added to a tournement with a player line:
    player <name> <seed rating>
Where name is a string with no spaces and seed rating is a decimal number.
There should be one player line per player that participates in the
tournament.

Player's can be removed from pairing consideration with a remove line:
    remove <name>

Player's can be re-added for consideration with an add line:
    add <name>

A bye is indicated with:
bye <name>
Byes can be forcefully counted as a win or loss with:
bye <name> [win|loss]

Game results are given with:
    game <player 1> <player 2> <result>
The words pair or pick can also be used in place of game.
player 1 and player 2 are the are the players in the game with player 1
making the first move.

    winner <winner name>
    draw
    double win
